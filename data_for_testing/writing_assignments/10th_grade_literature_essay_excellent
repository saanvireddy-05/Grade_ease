Textual Evidence and Analysis: The mockingbird symbol is introduced early in the novel when Atticus advises Scout and Jem that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. Miss Maudie explains, “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird” (Lee, 1960). This quote underscores the idea that mockingbirds symbolize innocence and goodness. Lee uses this symbol to reflect on the moral nature of her characters, particularly Tom Robinson and Boo Radley.
