Title: Investigating the Effect of Light Intensity on Photosynthesis in Elodea

Objective:
To investigate how different light intensities affect the rate of photosynthesis in the aquatic plant Elodea.

Materials:

Elodea plants
Beakers
Water
Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
Light source (lamp)
Light intensity meter
Stopwatch
Measuring ruler
Thermometer
Procedure:

Developing and Using Models:

Set up a model to simulate the aquatic environment for Elodea.
Use a beaker filled with water and add a small amount of baking soda to increase the carbon dioxide concentration.
Planning and Carrying Out Investigations:

Place a piece of Elodea in the beaker.
Position the light source at varying distances from the beaker to change light intensity (e.g., 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm).
Measure the light intensity at each distance using the light intensity meter.
Observe and count the number of oxygen bubbles produced by the Elodea in a 5-minute interval as an indicator of the rate of photosynthesis.
Repeat the experiment three times for each light intensity to ensure accurate results.
Analyzing and Interpreting Data:

Record the number of oxygen bubbles produced at each light intensity.
Calculate the average number of bubbles for each light intensity.
Create a graph to show the relationship between light intensity and the rate of photosynthesis.
Engaging in Argument from Evidence:

Based on the data, argue whether light intensity affects the rate of photosynthesis in Elodea.
Use the evidence from the experiment to support the argument.
Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information:

Write a detailed lab report including the objective, materials, procedure, data, analysis, and conclusion.
Evaluate the experiment for potential sources of error and suggest improvements.
Communicate the findings clearly and concisely in the lab report.
