In the quiet fields where sunlight weaves,
Among the rows of tender leaves,
There grows a secret, slowly told,
A tale of patience, time, and gold.

The vines are planted in the earth,
A humble start, a modest birth,
With roots that stretch and search below,
For water’s kiss, for life’s first glow.

Each morning brings a gentle care,
The dew, the sun, the breath of air,
A whisper soft, a nurturing hand,
In nature's dance, where dreams expand.

The seasons turn, the rains descend,
The tendrils reach, the branches bend,
A silent promise, growing still,
In quiet hours, through frost and chill.

The grapes appear, small, green, and shy,
Beneath the broad, expansive sky,
They swell with time, with sun’s embrace,
A patient heart, a tender grace.

Each day, a step, each night, a rest,
In nature’s rhythm, doing best,
To wait, to watch, to gently tend,
And trust the journey, to the end.

When autumn calls, the harvest comes,
The air is sweet with songs and hums,
Of ripened grapes, a bounty blessed,
A tribute to the patient quest.

In every grape, a lesson learned,
Of time well spent, of labors earned,
For in the vineyard’s quiet span,
We find the soul, the heart of man.

So let us take this truth to heart,
In every goal, in every start,
To wait, to trust, to gently tend,
And find the joy at journey’s end.
